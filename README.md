# Financial Data Analysis 

This project analyzes historical financial data and predicts stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Additionally, it calculates a credit score and rating based on financial metrics to evaluate a company's financial health.

## Overview

The project includes the following key functionalities:

1. *Data Retrieval*: Fetches historical stock prices and financial statements from Yahoo Finance for a given ticker symbol.
2. *Data Preprocessing*: Normalizes stock price data and prepares it for LSTM model training by creating time series datasets.
3. *Model Training*: Builds and trains an LSTM neural network to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
4. *Result Visualization*: Plots the predicted stock prices against the actual prices and calculates a credit score and rating using financial metrics.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- yfinance for retrieving financial data.
- matplotlib for plotting graphs.
- pandas for data manipulation.
- numpy for numerical operations.
- tensorflow for building and training the neural network.
- scikit-learn for data normalization.

You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
bashCopy code
pip install yfinance matplotlib pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn



## Getting Started

### Data Retrieval

The project retrieves financial data including historical stock prices and financial statements such as income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements for a specified ticker symbol.

### Data Preprocessing

The retrieved stock price data is normalized and transformed into a time series format suitable for training an LSTM model. This step ensures that the data is scaled appropriately for neural network processing.

### Model Training

An LSTM neural network model is created and trained using the preprocessed data. The model learns to predict future stock prices based on historical patterns.

### Result Visualization

After training, the modelâ€™s predictions are compared with actual stock prices, and visualizations are generated to display the results. The project also calculates a credit score and rating based on financial metrics such as net income, revenue, and operational efficiency.

## How to Use

1. *Fetch Data*: Run the script to fetch financial data for a specific ticker symbol.
2. *Preprocess Data*: Prepare the data by normalizing and creating time series datasets.
3. *Train Model*: Train the LSTM model using the preprocessed data.
4. *Visualize Results*: Generate plots showing predicted vs. actual stock prices and calculate the credit score and rating.

## Notes

- Ensure that the financial metrics used for credit score calculation align with the available columns in the data.
- Adjust column names and data handling as needed based on the structure of the retrieved financial data.
